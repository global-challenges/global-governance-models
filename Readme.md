# Call to Action

This Github repository contains a number of models for global governance designed to solve the main global problems and risks that threaten humanity. These models have been submitted by applicants from all across the world as a part of [the New Shape Prize competition](https://globalchallenges.org/en/our-work/the-new-shape-prize) ending in May 2018.

Each model consists of a 10,000 word submission addressing one of the main global catastrophic risks including weapons of mass destruction, catastrophic climate change, ecological collapse, pandemics, asteroid impact, supervulcanic eruption, geoengineering and artificial intelligence.

**As a call to action we are now inviting people to synthesize and combine these ideas into fully working concepts that can be successfully deployed at global scale.**

# Criteria
The assessment criteria for these models can be found [in the following PDF](https://github.com/global-challenges/global-governance-models/raw/master/Assessment%20Criteria.pdf).


# Instructions

## Access
To improve and synthesize ideas you need a personal Github account. [You can register a Github account here](https://github.com/join).


## Improving ideas

Use this process to suggest improvements to an existing idea or to synthesize multiple ideas into new ones.

#### 1. Navigate to the idea you want to improve.
For example [22. Hans Kelsen: Peace through law](https://github.com/global-challenges/global-governance-models/blob/master/22.%20Hans%20Kelsen%20-%20Peace%20through%20law.md). If you're synthesizing multiple ideas, just pick one of them.

#### 3. Make your desired changes to the idea.

This is your opportunity to synthesize multiple ideas and add parts that you believe are missing. If you want to add more advanced formatting than just plain text, [use the Markdown format specified here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

## What happens next?

After submitting your suggestion it will be publicly available and visible to everyone. It will then be reviewed by a panel of experts who look at it [based on the assessment criteria](https://github.com/global-challenges/global-governance-models/raw/master/Assessment%20Criteria.pdf).

If your suggestion meets the criteria it will be accepted and integrated into the original idea as a refinement.

You will receive notifications of progress both on Github and via email.


## Why Github?

The Global Challenges Foundation is currently investigating different platforms to determine the most adequate solution for an operation of this scale.

Github has been selected as a candidate based on its ability to handle large scale software projects where thousands of people collaborate in different cities across the globe.

Git is a well defined process that dictates version handling in a structured way where the entire history tree is maintained and one can easily trace the exact path of every change.

Other candidates that have been e.g.

* Google Docs
* Zoho Writer
