# Call to Action

This repository contains a number of models for global governance designed to solve the main global problems and risks that threaten humanity. These models have been submitted by applicants from all across the world as a part of [the New Shape Prize competition](https://globalchallenges.org/en/our-work/the-new-shape-prize) ending in May 2018.

Each model consists of a 10,000 word submission addressing one of the main global catastrophic risks including weapons of mass destruction, catastrophic climate change, ecological collapse, pandemics, asteroid impact, supervulcanic eruption, geoengineering and artificial intelligence.

**As a next call to action we are inviting people to synthesize and combine these ideas into fully working concepts that can be successfully deployed at global scale.**
