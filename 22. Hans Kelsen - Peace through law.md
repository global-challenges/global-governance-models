# 22. Hans Kelsen: _Peace through law_ 


# **Background and content**

**Hans Kelsen** (1881-1973) was a jurist and eminent legal theorist. He was originally from Austria but from the start of the Second World War he worked in the USA at the universities of Harvard and Berkeley. Kelsen's legal positivist view has greatly influenced the modern view of what law is and how the legal system works. In his book, _Peace through law_, Kelsen considers international law. The book was written in 1944, so the background is the Second World War and the experiences of the failure to maintain peace through the League of Nations. The question in the book is how strengthening international law could prevent a new world war. During this time, work was under way to create what was to become the UN, so the book could possibly be seen as a contribution to an ongoing political debate. 

In the book, Kelsen pleads for, among other things, the principle of individual responsibility for war crimes and puts forward a proposal for charters for a permanent world organisation with mandatory handover of all disputes between members to an international court.

Kelsen has a fundamental idea that separates him from all the other proposals studied within the frame of this assignment, namely that it is not legislative power or executive power that is at the centre of a global legal order but a court with mandatory jurisdiction over all states. According to Kelsen, the international court should therefore form the core of a new world organisation, and even though his proposals for charters also contain a general assembly, council, secretariat and secretary-general, like the UN, which was finally formed, the role of these institutions is strongly toned down compared with those of the UN. It is the court, not the assembly or council, that forms the core and that is where the important decisions are made. According to Kelsen, the key to peace is to handle all conflicts between states as legal matters. 

Kelsen's arguments are based partly on a political analysis of what the main obstacles to a global legal order are and partly on a legal theoretical analysis of what is required to institute working international law.

Kelsen then finds that the resistance by the nation states to waiving their legislative power to a global legislative assembly or to the drawing up of a global executive body with centralised means of power that are sufficient to implement global decisions is probably greater than their resistance to the setting up of a legal body with the task of applying existing international law. Kelsen points to historic examples that show that in international bodies in which political decisions should be taken, the states, not least the most powerful ones, have been unwilling to give up their national veto right in favour of majority decisions – something that has made these bodies less effective.

In the permanent international courts set up in 1902 and 1923, however, majority decisions by the court's members have led the way. According to Kelsen, the biggest problem with these courts has been that it has not been mandatory to refer international disputes to them.

On the question of which law the international court should apply when there is no international legislator, Kelsen argues partly that valid international law already exists that the court can apply and partly that it is the court's duty not just to interpret existing laws to the letter but also to develop international law. New laws are formed through precedential judgements. That is how international law has always worked and how national legislation has long worked in many countries according to Kelsen.

Kelsen also tones down the importance of having a centralised body to implement decisions. This can be left to the member states, according to Kelsen, by making it mandatory for every member state to take part in implementing the court's decisions. A country that does not meet this duty can then, in turn, be put on trial and suffer sanctions. Given that a sufficient number of countries expect that a sufficient number of other countries will comply with the court's decisions – and be prepared to implement them – it is rational for each one to comply with the decisions and agree to their implementation.

Central elements of Kelsen's proposal are also a prohibition against member countries waging war against other member countries regardless of reason, and permanent membership with no possibility of exit.

When it comes to the General Assembly, the mandate and tasks of which are fairly unclear, the member countries each appoint a representative, and decisions are taken according to the majority principle with one vote for each member. It is the job of the General Assembly to appoint the members to the Council and decide on changes to the charter with a three-quarter majority, but it otherwise appears to have a mainly advisory role. The proposed charter establishes that the General Assembly may express its view on anything, through majority decisions, but that binding decisions may not be taken about anything that is not in the charter.

The court should not make decisions that are binding. To guarantee that the judges are impartial and do not work for any country, they are appointed for life – or rather until they retire, normally assumed to be at the age of 70 years – and they renounce their citizenship and are given a special diplomatic passport for the time they serve in the court. They also may not have any form of commercial interests. 

The judges are appointed through a process in which courts and legal institutions in all the member countries nominate suitable persons. Each institution nominates one person from its own country and one from another country. Those nominated by institutions in other countries than their own are put on one list and those nominated by their own country on another. Based on the number of nominations, nine persons are appointed from the first list, while the General Assembly chooses eight persons from the second list. New lists are drawn up every four years, and if any judge leaves or retires, a new member is appointed from the list from which the departing judge was chosen.

According to the proposal, the Council should have members from four permanent members – the USA, the Soviet Union, China and Great Britain – and a further unspecified number of members elected by the General Assembly. The mandate period is not specified.

Kelsen is basically positive to a more far-reaching global political organisation, and he does not rule out a world state in the distant future. However, he believes that it is completely unrealistic to set one up in the short term and sees a global legal order based on an international court as a realistic solution and a way forwards towards a possible future world state.
